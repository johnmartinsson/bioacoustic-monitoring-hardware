**1. Microphone Selection:**

For the microphone selection, we can keep the same recommendations as for the RedNet/AoIP solution, as high-quality microphones are essential regardless of the interface type:

*   **Primary Recommendation (DPA): DPA 4060 or DPA 4061 Miniature Omnidirectional Microphones:** (Refer to previous detailed description in the RedNet solution for pros/cons and suitability).
*   **Alternative 1: Sennheiser MKH 8040 Cardioid Condenser Microphone:** (Refer to previous detailed description).
*   **Alternative 2 (More Budget-Friendly):  Audio-Technica AT4051b Cardioid Condenser Microphone:** (Refer to previous detailed description).

**Windshielding and Moisture Protection:**  Same recommendations apply â€“ high-quality windshields are crucial for outdoor recording, and moisture protection accessories are recommended for the Baltic Sea environment.

**2. USB Audio Interface Selection:**

For a USB solution, we need a high-quality multi-channel USB audio interface. Here are a few recommendations, considering channel count (4-8 inputs), preamp quality, and reliability:

*   **High-End Option (Excellent Quality & Features): RME Fireface UFX II USB Audio Interface:**
    *   **Pros:**  Exceptional audio quality, transparent preamps, very low latency USB performance, robust drivers (RME is known for driver stability), high channel count (12 mic/line inputs), and extensive features (as detailed in the manual you provided).  Offers excellent TotalMix FX software for routing and monitoring (though you might not use all advanced features for a simple setup).  Serves as a benchmark for high-quality USB interfaces.
    *   **Cons:**  More expensive than other USB interfaces.  Potentially more features than strictly needed for a basic 4-8 mic setup (though features can be beneficial).
    *   **Why RME Fireface UFX II is a good (though potentially overkill) option:** If absolute audio quality and rock-solid reliability are top priorities, and budget is less of a constraint, the Fireface UFX II is an outstanding choice.  It's a professional-grade interface that will perform exceptionally well.

*   **Mid-Range Option (Good Balance of Quality & Cost): Focusrite Clarett+ OctoPre USB Audio Interface:**
    *   **Pros:**  8 high-quality Clarett+ microphone preamps (good sound, low noise), USB connectivity, good value for the price, Focusrite drivers are generally reliable.  Offers ADAT expandability if you need to add more channels later (though for AoIP expansion, RedNet is better).
    *   **Cons:**  Not *quite* the absolute top-tier audio quality of RME, but still very good for bioacoustics. USB only (no Thunderbolt option). Fewer built-in features compared to Fireface UFX II.
    *   **Why Clarett+ OctoPre USB is a good mid-range option:**  Offers a solid balance of excellent preamp quality, sufficient channel count for your 4-8 mic needs, and a more reasonable price point than the Fireface UFX II.  A practical choice for high-quality USB recording without extreme high-end features.

*   **More Budget-Conscious Option:  PreSonus Studio 1824c USB Audio Interface:**
    *   **Pros:**  8 microphone preamps, USB-C connectivity, good value for the price, PreSonus drivers are generally stable.  Offers ADAT expandability for future expansion.  More affordable than RME or Focusrite Clarett+.
    *   **Cons:**  Preamps are not as high-end as RME or Focusrite Clarett+, but still decent quality for bioacoustics.  May have slightly higher latency compared to RME/Focusrite.
    *   **Why PreSonus Studio 1824c is a budget-conscious option:**  If budget is a strong constraint, the Studio 1824c is a very capable interface that provides 8 mic preamps at a lower cost.  A good option for getting started with a USB-based system without breaking the bank.

**3. Stage Rack and XLR Cables (Long Run):**

*   **Stage Rack (Akulab):**  Using a stage rack in the Akulab structure is a practical approach to centralize microphone connections. A basic, robust stage rack (or snake box) with XLR inputs is needed.  Choose one with enough XLR inputs for your maximum microphone count (8 inputs recommended for future expansion).  Make sure it's reasonably weather-resistant or can be placed under some shelter within Akulab to minimize direct exposure.
*   **XLR Cables (40m Run, High Quality):**  For the 40-meter cable run from the Akulab stage rack to the server building, **high-quality, low-capacitance, balanced XLR cables are crucial.**  Long cable runs can introduce signal degradation and noise, especially with microphone signals.
    *   **Cable Type:**  Use professional-grade microphone cable designed for long runs.  Look for cables with:
        *   **Low Capacitance:** To minimize high-frequency signal loss over long distances.
        *   **Good Shielding:** To reject electromagnetic interference (EMI) and radio frequency interference (RFI). Star-quad cabling (like Canare StarQuad L-4E6S or Mogami Neglex W2552) offers excellent noise rejection.
        *   **Heavy Gauge Conductors:** For better signal conductivity.
    *   **Connector Quality:**  Use high-quality XLR connectors (Neutrik connectors are industry-standard and very reliable).
    *   **Cable Testing:**  *Test the 40-meter XLR cables thoroughly* before deployment to ensure they are functioning correctly and not introducing excessive noise or signal loss.

**4. Hardware Components List (USB Solution):**

1.  **Microphones:** 4-8 high-quality condenser microphones (DPA 4060/4061, Sennheiser MKH 8040, or Audio-Technica AT4051b).
2.  **Microphone Cables (Short XLR):** High-quality balanced XLR cables (short lengths to connect mics to stage rack).
3.  **Stage Rack (XLR Inputs):**  8-channel or larger stage rack with XLR inputs.
4.  **XLR Cables (Long Run - 40m):**  High-quality, low-capacitance, shielded XLR cables (40 meters length, quantity based on mic count).
5.  **USB Audio Interface:** Multi-channel USB audio interface (RME Fireface UFX II, Focusrite Clarett+ OctoPre USB, or PreSonus Studio 1824c).
6.  **Server/Computer (Existing):** Dedicated server or powerful computer for recording and processing (assumed existing).
    *   Operating System: Windows or macOS (Linux possible with more configuration).
    *   Recording Software (DAW or specialized bioacoustic software with ASIO/Core Audio support - Reaper, Audacity, Raven Pro, etc.).
    *   Ample storage for long-term 24-bit/48kHz multi-channel recordings (assumed existing or easily added).
7.  **Weatherproof Enclosure(s):**  Outdoor-rated enclosure(s) for the USB audio interface and stage rack (if needed in Akulab itself). IP65+ recommended for stage rack area if exposed. Enclosure for USB interface in server building (less critical weatherproof requirements in building, but still consider dust/humidity protection).
    *   **Heating/Cooling & Humidity Control:**  Less critical for USB interface in server building (assuming building is climate-controlled), but consider for stage rack area in Akulab if electronics are placed there.
8.  **Microphone Mounting Hardware, Windshields, Time Synchronization Solution:** (Same as RedNet plan - see previous detailed lists).

**B. Step-by-Step Installation Procedure (USB Solution):**

1.  **Environmental Enclosure Setup (Stage Rack Area):**
    *   Install a weatherproof enclosure (if needed) in the Akulab structure to house the stage rack. Consider weather protection for the stage rack area even without a full enclosure.
2.  **Stage Rack Mounting & Cabling (Akulab):**
    *   Mount the stage rack securely in Akulab.
    *   Position and mount microphones in Akulab. Attach windshields.
    *   Connect microphones to the XLR inputs on the stage rack using short XLR cables.
3.  **Long XLR Cable Run:**
    *   Run the 40-meter XLR cables from the XLR outputs on the stage rack to the server building.
    *   Ensure cables are properly routed and protected from damage (cable ties, conduit if needed).
4.  **USB Audio Interface Setup (Server Building):**
    *   Place the USB audio interface in the server building, ideally in a protected location (enclosure if dust/humidity is a concern).
    *   Connect the 40-meter XLR cables from Akulab to the XLR inputs on the USB audio interface.
    *   Connect the USB audio interface to the server/computer using a USB cable.
5.  **Software Installation & Configuration (Server):**
    *   Install drivers for your chosen USB audio interface on the server.
    *   Install your recording software (DAW or bioacoustic software) on the server.
    *   Configure the recording software to use your USB audio interface (ASIO driver on Windows, Core Audio on macOS) as the audio input device.
6.  **Recording Software Configuration:**
    *   In your recording software, configure multi-track recording, input channel mapping to match your microphone inputs, sample rate (48 kHz), and bit depth (24-bit).
7.  **Testing and Optimization:**
    *   Test the entire audio recording system. Record test audio and verify signals from all microphones are being received on separate tracks.
    *   Adjust preamp gains on the USB audio interface (typically physical knobs on the interface) to optimize recording levels.
    *   Check for any noise issues or signal degradation due to the long cable run. If noise is excessive, consider using microphone preamps closer to the mics in Akulab and running line-level signals over the 40m distance (more complex setup).
8.  **Time Synchronization (Same as RedNet Plan):** Implement NTP, PTP, or scratch mic synchronization as described in the RedNet setup plan for video-audio sync.
9.  **Long-Term Recording Setup:** Configure recording software for scheduled recording, file splitting, metadata, etc.

**5. Synchronization Strategy (USB Solution):**

The synchronization strategy for video and audio remains the same as outlined in the RedNet/AoIP solution:

*   **Ideal (PTP if supported):** PTP Grandmaster clock synchronization for cameras, Milestone, and server time.
*   **Good (NTP):** NTP server synchronization for cameras, Milestone, and server system time.
*   **Practical (Scratch Mics):** Software-based synchronization using scratch mics in IP cameras and audible event alignment or cross-correlation in post-processing.
*   **Hybrid:** Combine NTP for baseline camera/Milestone sync with scratch mics for fine-grained audio-video alignment.

**7. Key Concerns for USB Solution:**

*   **Long XLR Cable Run (40m):**  Signal quality can degrade over long XLR runs. Using high-quality, low-capacitance, shielded cables is essential. Test cables thoroughly. If signal quality is still an issue, consider moving preamps closer to mics or using line-level transmission (more complex setup).
*   **USB Cable Length Limits:** Standard USB cables have length limitations (typically around 5 meters without active extension).  Ensure your server can be positioned within USB cable reach of the USB audio interface in the server building, or explore USB extension options (active USB extension cables or USB over Ethernet extenders, but these can introduce latency and potential reliability issues).
*   **Synchronization:** USB audio interfaces do not inherently provide sample-accurate synchronization across multiple interfaces like Dante does. For expansion beyond 8 mics, synchronization would become a more significant challenge with USB. For your initial 4-8 mic setup with a single USB interface, internal clock synchronization within the interface should be sufficient.
*   **Scalability:** USB solutions are less scalable than AoIP. Expanding beyond the input capacity of a single USB interface becomes more complex and might require multiple USB interfaces, which can introduce synchronization challenges and driver compatibility issues. If future expansion is highly likely, AoIP (RedNet) is a more scalable long-term path.
*   **Environmental Protection (Stage Rack Area):** Pay close attention to weatherproofing and environmental protection for the stage rack area in Akulab, especially if electronics are placed there.

This USB-based solution provides a simpler and potentially more budget-friendly starting point for your bioacoustic monitoring project. However, carefully consider the limitations, especially related to cable runs and scalability, compared to the AoIP/RedNet solution, especially if future expansion is anticipated.
