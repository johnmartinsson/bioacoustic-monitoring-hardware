# Strengths
- **High Loudness (124dB SPL max)**: Suitable for broadcasting loud, clear announcements over large distances.
- **Durable and Weatherproof (IP67)**: Can withstand outdoor conditions, including exposure to rain, dust, and extreme temperatures.
- **External Microphone Support**: Can be equipped with an additional microphone to detect environmental sounds.
- **Standalone & IP-based**: Does not require a dedicated server, can integrate with an existing IP network.
- **Power over Ethernet (PoE) Support**: Simplifies installation by reducing cable clutter.

# Weaknesses
- **Limited Frequency Range (7.5kHz – 12kHz)**: This range is more suited for voice transmission rather than capturing a full spectrum of bird sounds. Many bird calls fall outside this range.
- **Primarily Designed for Announcements**: The device is optimized for broadcasting and security purposes rather than high-fidelity audio recording.
- **Audio Codecs Focused on Speech Compression**: The supported codecs are mostly designed for VoIP communication, meaning audio quality may not be optimal for bioacoustics analysis.

# Suitability for Guillemot Monitoring
The **2N SIP Speaker Horn** is not an ideal choice for your project. While it is highly durable and supports external microphones, its **limited frequency range** and **focus on speech-based applications** make it **unsuitable for capturing the full spectrum of bird calls and colony ambient sounds**. A **microphone with a broader frequency response and higher dynamic range** would be better suited for your research.
