This is a fantastic real-world scenario, and you're right, perfectly uniform placement is likely impossible and perhaps even undesirable given the habitat structure.  Let's break down how to approach microphone placement in the Karlsö Murre Lab for sound event localization.

**Key Takeaways for Your Situation:**

1. **Embrace Non-Uniformity, but Optimize Within Constraints:**  You *will* have a non-uniform array.  Don't fight it. Instead, focus on *strategically* placing the microphones within the shelf structure to maximize localization performance given the constraints.  Optimization is crucial, but it's optimization *for a non-uniform array*.

2. **Standard SEL Techniques are Adaptable, but Consider Modifications:**  Yes, you can use standard techniques (TDOA, beamforming, subspace methods). However, be prepared to:
    * **Accurately Measure Microphone Positions:**  Crucially important. You'll need precise 3D coordinates of each microphone in your array.
    * **Use Algorithms Designed for or Adaptable to Non-Uniform Arrays:** Some algorithms handle non-uniformity more gracefully than others.  You might need to adjust parameters or choose specific implementations.
    * **Simulate and Test:**  Extensive simulation and real-world testing in the lab environment will be essential to validate your array design and algorithm choices.

3. **Prioritize *Strategic* Non-Uniform Placement over Random Placement:**  Don't just randomly scatter microphones.  Think about how to leverage the shelf structure to your advantage.

**Detailed Considerations and Recommendations for Karlsö Murre Lab:**

**1. Understanding the Habitat's Impact on Array Design:**

* **"Bookshelf" Structure:** This is the defining characteristic.
    * **Vertical Stacking:** Microphones on different shelves will have vertical separation, which is good for 3D localization.
    * **Horizontal "Folds":** The folds in the backplane mean the array will not be planar. This is also not necessarily bad, but it means you need to consider the 3D geometry.
    * **Booth-like Shelves:** These might act as small acoustic enclosures. This could be both a benefit (reducing noise from outside) and a challenge (reflections within the booth).
    * **Open Side to Ocean:**  This is the primary sound source direction. You want good sensitivity and resolution in this direction.

**2. Strategic Microphone Placement within the Shelves:**

* **Maximize Spatial Diversity:**  Even within the constraints of the shelves, try to achieve spatial diversity in all three dimensions (x, y, z).
    * **Spread Microphones Across Shelves (Vertically):**  Use the vertical stacking of shelves to your advantage. Place microphones on different vertical levels to get height information.
    * **Spread Microphones Within Each Shelf (Horizontally and Depth):** Within each shelf, try to spread microphones out horizontally and even in depth (if possible within the booth structure).  Don't cluster them all in one corner.
    * **Consider Edge vs. Center Placement:** Microphones near the edges of shelves might capture sounds propagating along the shelves, while central microphones might be more representative of sounds originating directly from the booths. A mix might be beneficial.

* **Think about Array Aperture (Even Non-Uniformly):**  Try to maximize the *effective aperture* of your array.  This means maximizing the distance between the *most spatially separated* microphones, even if the spacing isn't uniform in between.  Larger aperture generally improves spatial resolution, especially at lower frequencies.

* **Consider Sparsity (If Appropriate):**  Given you have 25 microphones, you might consider a somewhat *sparse* non-uniform array.  Sparse arrays can sometimes achieve better spatial resolution than uniformly spaced arrays with the same number of microphones, especially when optimized. However, they can also be more prone to spatial aliasing if not designed carefully.

* **Placement in Relation to Bird Nesting Locations (If Known/Predictable):** If you have some idea where birds are most likely to vocalize within the shelves (e.g., nesting spots), you might slightly bias microphone placement towards those areas.  However, be careful not to introduce bias that limits your ability to detect sounds from other locations.

**3. Algorithm Considerations for Non-Uniform Arrays:**

* **Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) Methods (GCC-PHAT):**  Still very viable.  The core principle of estimating delays is independent of array geometry.  You *must* have accurate microphone positions to translate TDOAs to directions.
* **Beamforming (Delay-and-Sum, MVDR):**
    * **Delay-and-Sum:** Can be adapted, but you need to calculate steering vectors based on the *actual* microphone positions for each direction you want to beamform towards.
    * **MVDR (Minimum Variance Distortionless Response):**  Generally well-suited for non-uniform arrays as it's data-adaptive and implicitly accounts for array geometry through the covariance matrix.  Requires more computation than Delay-and-Sum.
* **Subspace Methods (MUSIC, ESPRIT):**  Also adaptable to non-uniform arrays.  They rely on the signal and noise subspaces which can be estimated from the data regardless of array geometry.  Again, accurate microphone positions are needed.

**4. Essential Steps for Implementation and Optimization:**

* **Precise Measurement of Microphone Positions:** Use accurate measurement tools (e.g., laser scanner, total station, or even careful manual measurements with calibrated instruments and multiple reference points) to determine the 3D coordinates of each microphone *after* installation.  Accuracy is paramount for non-uniform arrays.
* **Simulation and Modeling:**
    * **Model the Habitat Geometry:** Create a 3D model of the shelf structure as accurately as possible.
    * **Simulate Microphone Placement:**  Virtually place your microphones in the model based on your planned locations.
    * **Simulate Sound Propagation:**  Ideally, simulate sound propagation within the modeled habitat (though this can be complex). At minimum, simulate plane waves from different directions impinging on the array.
    * **Test SEL Algorithms:**  Simulate bird vocalizations from various locations within the habitat and test the performance of different SEL algorithms with your planned array configuration.  Experiment with different microphone placements *virtually* to see which performs best.
* **Calibration in Situ:**
    * **Acoustic Calibration:**  Once installed, perform acoustic calibration. You can use a known sound source (e.g., a loudspeaker emitting a broadband signal or a known bird call) placed at various locations in the habitat to:
        * Verify microphone positions (to some extent, by checking if localization is accurate for known source locations).
        * Calibrate for gain and phase mismatches between microphones.
        * Characterize the acoustic environment (reverberation, reflections).
* **Iterative Refinement:** Be prepared for iterative refinement. Your initial placement might not be optimal. Analyze the data collected after initial deployment, identify areas of poor localization performance, and consider adjusting microphone positions (if possible and practical) and algorithm parameters.

**5. Practical Considerations:**

* **Environmental Protection:** Microphones will be exposed to the elements (Baltic Sea climate, seabird activity). Choose robust, weatherproof microphones and consider protective housings if needed.
* **Cable Management:** 25 microphones will require significant cable management. Plan for routing, securing, and protecting cables.
* **Power and Data Acquisition:**  Consider how you will power 25 microphones and acquire the data.  Networked microphones or a multi-channel data acquisition system will be necessary.
* **Maintenance and Accessibility:** Ensure microphones are accessible for maintenance, replacement, and potential repositioning.
* **Noise Reduction:**  Consider strategies to minimize environmental noise (wind, waves, other bird species outside the lab).  Directional microphones or windscreen might be helpful.  Signal processing techniques for noise reduction will also be important.

**In summary:** You can definitely use standard SEL techniques in the Karlsö Murre Lab, even with a non-uniform array.  However, the key to success is **strategic microphone placement within the habitat constraints and rigorous optimization through simulation, calibration, and potentially iterative refinement.**  Prioritize accurate microphone position measurement and be prepared to adapt your signal processing algorithms to the non-uniform geometry. This unique setup has the potential to provide fascinating insights into seabird behavior! Good luck with your project!
