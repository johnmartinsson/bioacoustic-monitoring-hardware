Based on the provided documentation, Milestone’s video management system (**XProtect VMS**) explicitly relies on **Network Time Protocol (NTP)** for synchronization. The official Milestone documentation emphasizes using an NTP server (either a dedicated NTP server, domain controller, or the VMS server itself acting as an NTP server) for time synchronization.

**Implications for Your Project:**

- **Audio (AoIP / Dante):**
  - Your audio-over-IP setup (using Dante, AES67, or similar) can easily leverage **Precision Time Protocol (PTP)** for synchronization.
  - Dante/AES67 commonly use **PTPv2**, enabling microsecond-level accuracy ideal for audio synchronization.

- **Video (Milestone XProtect):**
  - Milestone systems explicitly recommend or require **NTP**.
  - Cameras and servers synchronize via standard NTP services (Microsoft or 3rd-party NTP servers).

**Can you use PTP directly with Milestone?**

- As of now, Milestone’s documentation does **not indicate support for PTP synchronization**. It explicitly outlines **NTP** as the synchronization standard.
- This means you cannot directly synchronize Milestone’s VMS or cameras using a PTP source without additional bridging solutions.

## Recommended Synchronization Strategy for your scenario:

Since your goal is to synchronize audio streams (using AoIP via Dante/PTP) with Milestone-managed IP cameras and video feeds (via NTP), you have two realistic options:

### Option 1 (Hybrid Sync - recommended):

- Set up a reliable **NTP server** as your primary timing reference (this could be a server already running Milestone).
- Sync all your Milestone-managed cameras and servers to this NTP server.
- Install a **PTP Grandmaster clock** (with GPS for absolute accuracy, if possible).
- Configure your **Dante/AES67 audio network** to use the PTP Grandmaster.
- Sync the PTP Grandmaster clock (audio) and NTP server (video) to the same absolute reference (GPS or common stable source). Many professional Grandmaster clocks can output both PTP and NTP simultaneously, ensuring tight synchronization between the two protocols.

**Pros:**
- Best of both worlds: Milestone video infrastructure remains NTP-compliant.
- Audio infrastructure retains PTP’s microsecond-level accuracy.

**Cons:**
- Additional complexity and cost (dedicated Grandmaster clock).

---

### Option 2 (NTP-only, simpler but lower accuracy):

- Use a single NTP server.
- Set Dante network to operate in **AES67 compatibility mode**, which supports PTPv2 derived from NTP. This approach may sacrifice some precision compared to pure PTP setups but will maintain synchronization sufficiently for many applications.

**Pros:**
- Very straightforward and minimal complexity.
- No specialized equipment required.

**Cons:**
- Lower synchronization precision (milliseconds rather than microseconds), may not be ideal for critical audio/video sync scenarios.

---

### Conclusion & Recommended Approach:

Given Milestone's explicit reliance on NTP, you cannot enforce PTP directly on their infrastructure. However, you are **not strictly limited** to NTP alone for audio. The recommended industry-standard solution is a **hybrid approach (Option 1)** using a Grandmaster clock providing both NTP and PTP outputs. This approach ensures:

- Perfect interoperability with Milestone via NTP.
- Precise audio synchronization via PTP for Dante/AES67 audio-over-IP.

This hybrid strategy represents best practice in professional broadcast/IP-audio environments.

Here's a concise and practical summary highlighting the key differences between the synchronization accuracy guarantees of **NTP** (Network Time Protocol) and **PTP** (Precision Time Protocol):

| Aspect                        | NTP (Network Time Protocol)                          | PTP (Precision Time Protocol - IEEE 1588)               |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Typical Accuracy**          | Milliseconds (1-10 ms typically)                     | Microseconds or sub-microseconds (<1 µs possible)      |
| **Accuracy Guarantee**        | No strict deterministic guarantees; network-dependent | Deterministic, with clearly defined accuracy levels     |
| **Network Requirements**      | Minimal: Can run over WAN/internet                   | High-quality local networks required for best accuracy  |
| **Infrastructure Complexity** | Simple; can run on standard networks                 | More complex; requires PTP-aware switches for highest precision |
| **Clock Hierarchy**           | Client-server (usually a public NTP server or local server)  | Master-follower (Grandmaster clock, boundary clocks, transparent clocks) |
| **Traffic Type**              | Typically unicast                                    | Multicast or Unicast (PTPv2 supports both; multicast is common) |
| **Use Cases**                 | General IT systems, general video surveillance (e.g., Milestone) | Professional broadcast, audio/video production, Dante/AES67 networks |
| **Failure Mode**              | Graceful drift; relatively large synchronization errors possible | Small and stable synchronization errors; highly stable clocking |

### Practical implications for your scenario:

- **NTP** is sufficient for general video recording (like Milestone XProtect), where millisecond-level accuracy is adequate to synchronize video frames and timestamps. This accuracy is typically sufficient for surveillance video, playback, and security purposes.

- **PTP** is essential for audio networks (Dante/AES67) in professional settings because it delivers sub-microsecond synchronization, necessary for precise phase-alignment and digital audio integrity—especially critical in scenarios involving live audio, multi-microphone arrays, and synchronized video-audio production workflows.

### In short:

- Use **NTP** when "close enough" synchronization is acceptable (milliseconds accuracy).
- Use **PTP** when high-precision synchronization (microsecond accuracy) is required, typically in professional audio or broadcast scenarios.

Given your scenario—integrating audio (AoIP/Dante) with video (Milestone)—the optimal setup would typically use a high-accuracy **PTP** for audio, with a secondary **NTP** service synchronized from the same PTP Grandmaster for Milestone’s video synchronization requirements.

Setting up a hybrid synchronization scenario (PTP for audio and NTP for video) with your RedNet MP8R is achievable but involves careful planning. Below is a clear outline of what you'll need to consider, specifically relating to the **RedNet MP8R** device capabilities and configuration:

---

### 1. **Is Hybrid Sync Tricky to Set Up?**

**Short answer:**  
It is more involved than using NTP or PTP alone, but very manageable with good planning.

**Detailed answer:**  
Hybrid synchronization involves ensuring that both your NTP-based video (Milestone) and your PTP-based audio (RedNet MP8R via Dante) derive their time from a common reference, typically a GPS-based Grandmaster clock. It's straightforward once the concept is understood, but you'll need specialized hardware (PTP Grandmaster with NTP output capability).

---

### 2. **RedNet MP8R and Sync Capabilities**

The RedNet MP8R supports the Dante audio-over-IP protocol, which uses Precision Time Protocol (**PTPv1** or **PTPv2/AES67**) as its synchronization standard:

- **RedNet MP8R Clocking:**
  - Automatically locks to a valid Dante network master (PTP).
  - Can act as the network master if required.
  - Supports pull-up/pull-down sample rates selectable via Dante Controller.

**Important Considerations from the RedNet MP8R Manual:**
- **Clock Source:** The MP8R automatically locks onto the Dante network's clock. If there isn't an existing network master, the MP8R can serve as the master.
- **Supported sample rates:** 44.1 / 48 / 88.2 / 96 / 176.4 / 192 kHz.
- **Redundancy:** Dual Ethernet connections and dual PSU inputs make the MP8R suitable for critical setups. Redundant network connections allow automatic failover.

---

### 3. **Hybrid Sync Setup Steps (Detailed for RedNet MP8R):**

**Step 1: Install a GPS-based Grandmaster Clock**
- Choose a Grandmaster clock device (e.g., Meinberg, Tekron, Evertz, or others).
- Device should provide both:
  - PTP output (IEEE 1588v2), ideally AES67 compliant.
  - NTP output (for Milestone VMS).

**Step 2: Configure Grandmaster**
- Set it up with GPS reference to provide highly accurate UTC-based time.
- Enable both **PTP output** and **NTP output**.

**Step 3: Configure Dante network (RedNet MP8R)**
- Connect the RedNet MP8R (via primary/secondary Dante ports) to a suitable network switch.
- Set Dante network to use the Grandmaster’s PTP clock as the master clock.
- RedNet MP8R will automatically lock to the PTP clock.

**Step 4: Configure Milestone VMS**
- Set Milestone's servers and IP cameras to synchronize with the **NTP output** from the same Grandmaster.
- Confirm NTP synchronization across Milestone servers and cameras.

**Step 5: Confirm Synchronization**
- Once configured, audio and video are synchronized indirectly through a common reference. The video uses NTP, and the audio uses PTP, both tracing back to the same Grandmaster.

---

### 4. **Critical Points to Consider**

- **Switch Compatibility:**  
  PTP accuracy depends on network hardware. Professional-grade switches with IEEE 1588 (PTP-aware switches) are recommended for microsecond-level accuracy.

- **Grandmaster Clock Accuracy:**  
  A GPS-based Grandmaster clock ensures absolute accuracy and a stable common time reference.

- **Network Topology & Traffic Management:**  
  Use VLANs to separate audio (PTP) from general network traffic to ensure timing accuracy and minimize jitter.

- **RedNet Control Software:**  
  Make use of the RedNet Control software provided by Focusrite to:
  - Check synchronization status.
  - Confirm clock status ("Network Locked" indicator on the MP8R front panel and software interface).
  - Manage channel configurations and gain compensation features.

---

### 5. **Potential Challenges**

- **Mixed Protocol Management:**  
  Managing two synchronization protocols (NTP and PTP) simultaneously introduces complexity; clearly document settings.
- **Budget & Equipment:**  
  The need for specialized Grandmaster clock equipment may impact your budget.
- **Technical Knowledge:**  
  Familiarity with Dante Controller, network management, and synchronization technology is required.

---

### 6. **Benefits of the Hybrid Approach**

- **Accuracy:**  
  Audio synchronization remains precise (microsecond accuracy), ensuring the integrity of bioacoustic recordings.
- **Milestone Integration:**  
  Full compatibility with Milestone VMS through NTP, fulfilling their explicit synchronization requirement.
- **Scalability:**  
  Future expansions (more audio or video devices) remain straightforward and centrally manageable.

---

### 7. **Conclusion & Recommendation**

- While the hybrid synchronization solution is slightly more complex initially, it ensures:
  - Optimal synchronization accuracy for audio (via PTP/Dante).
  - Compliance with Milestone's NTP requirement for video.
  - Highly reliable operation, crucial for long-term bioacoustic monitoring projects.

Given the robust clocking and redundancy features of the **RedNet MP8R**, your choice to use this device positions your setup very effectively for professional-level synchronization and reliability.
