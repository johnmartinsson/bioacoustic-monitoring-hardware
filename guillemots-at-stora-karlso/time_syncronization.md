# USB Audio
Yes, you can absolutely connect a Milestone system to your Raspberry Pi GPS NTP server for time synchronization. Milestone VMS (Video Management Systems) are designed to synchronize their system clocks with NTP servers. This is a standard and recommended practice for ensuring accurate timestamps in video recordings and events.

Regarding tagging audio recorded with a USB soundcard with NTP timestamps and your "keep both times" approach, let's break it down:

**Milestone and NTP Synchronization:**

* **Easy Integration:** Milestone systems are typically configured to use NTP servers.  You would simply configure the Milestone server (and potentially recording devices, depending on your Milestone setup) to use the IP address of your Raspberry Pi NTP server.
* **Video Timestamping:** Milestone will use the NTP-synchronized system time to timestamp video recordings and events within the VMS. This will ensure your video streams are accurately timestamped according to your GPS-derived time.

**Audio Timestamping and the "Keep Both Times" Approach:**

Your "keep both times" approach – logging both the USB audio device's internal clock time and the NTP time concurrently – **makes excellent sense** for your application and is likely the most robust and accurate method for your requirements. Here's why and how to proceed:

**Why "Keep Both Times" is a Good Strategy:**

1. **Addressing Audio Clock Drift:** You correctly identify that even a "very accurate" internal clock on the USB soundcard will drift over 120 days. Simply relying on the audio device's clock alone for absolute time reference will become inaccurate.

2. **Avoiding Real-Time NTP Correction Complexity/Imprecision:**  Attempting to directly *correct* the audio device's clock in real-time using NTP is complex and potentially problematic:
    * **USB Audio Device Control:** USB audio devices typically don't expose interfaces to directly adjust their internal clocks based on external time signals like NTP.
    * **Real-time Correction Jitter:** Even if it were possible, real-time corrections based on NTP over a network might introduce small jumps or jitter into the audio timestamps due to network latency variations and NTP correction intervals. This could be detrimental to high-precision time difference of arrival (TDOA) calculations.
    * **Post-Processing Flexibility:** Logging both timestamps gives you the flexibility to perform sophisticated drift correction and mapping in post-processing, where you have more control and can apply smoothing or more advanced algorithms.

3. **Robustness and Independent Time Streams:**  You maintain two independent time streams:
    * **NTP Time:** Provides the accurate, absolute time reference synchronized to GPS.
    * **Audio Device Time:** Captures the high-resolution, relative time within the audio stream, even if it drifts.
    * By logging both, you can bridge the gap and leverage the strengths of each.

**How to Implement "Keep Both Times":**

1. **Audio Recording Software Modification (Ideal):**
   * **If you have control over the audio recording software:**  Modify it to:
      * **Record Audio Samples:** Capture the raw audio data from the USB soundcard.
      * **Timestamp Audio Samples:**  At regular intervals (e.g., for each audio frame or buffer), record the current timestamp from the USB soundcard's internal clock. This timestamp will be relative to the start of the recording or some internal zero point of the audio device.
      * **Simultaneously Log NTP Time:**  At the *same* or very closely synchronized intervals as you record the audio timestamps, also record the current NTP system time (obtained from the operating system's clock, which is synchronized to your NTP server).
      * **Save Log Data:** Store both the audio timestamps and the corresponding NTP timestamps together in a log file, ideally alongside or interleaved with the audio data.

2. **Separate NTP Time Logging Process (Alternative if Software Modification is Limited):**
   * **If you cannot directly modify the audio recording software:** Create a separate process or script that runs concurrently with the audio recording.
   * **Independent NTP Logger:** This script would periodically (at a rate fast enough to capture drift, e.g., every few seconds or even more frequently) query the system time (NTP time) and log it along with a timestamp from the system clock at the moment of querying.
   * **Synchronization Points:**  You'll need to find a way to synchronize the timestamps from this separate NTP log with the timestamps generated by your audio recording software. This might involve:
      * **Starting Both Processes Simultaneously:**  If you can start both the audio recording and the NTP logging process very close in time, you can use the start times as a rough synchronization point.
      * **Manual Synchronization Events:** Introduce manual events (e.g., a clap sound, a specific visual cue) at the beginning and end of recordings that are recorded in both the audio and video streams. These events can be used as anchor points for time alignment in post-processing.

**Post-Processing Mapping and Drift Correction:**

1. **Load Logged Data:** In your post-processing analysis software (e.g., Python with libraries like NumPy, SciPy), load the log data containing both the audio timestamps and the NTP timestamps.

2. **Establish Mapping Relationship:**  You'll have pairs of (audio_timestamp, NTP_timestamp) recorded at intervals. You can use these pairs to model the relationship between the audio clock and NTP time.

3. **Drift Modeling (Linear or More Complex):**
   * **Linear Interpolation (Simple):**  If the drift is relatively linear over short intervals, you can use linear interpolation between the logged NTP timestamps to estimate the NTP time corresponding to any audio timestamp.
   * **Polynomial Fitting (More Complex):** For longer recordings or if you observe non-linear drift, you might fit a polynomial (e.g., quadratic) to the (audio_timestamp, NTP_timestamp) data points. This allows you to model more complex drift patterns.
   * **Kalman Filtering (Advanced):** For very precise drift estimation, especially if there is noise in the NTP or audio timestamps, you could consider using Kalman filtering techniques.

4. **Apply Mapping to Audio Timestamps:**  Once you have a drift model, you can use it to convert every audio timestamp in your recording to its corresponding NTP time.

5. **Sound Localization Analysis:** Now you have audio streams with timestamps that are effectively in NTP time, synchronized with your video streams (which are also in NTP time thanks to Milestone). You can perform your time difference of arrival (TDOA) calculations and sound localization analysis using these synchronized timestamps.

**Accuracy Considerations for Sound Localization:**

* **NTP Accuracy for Mapping:**  While NTP corrections might have some jitter, the overall NTP time provided by your GPS-based server will be accurate enough to establish a reliable mapping for your audio clock drift over 120 days. The *precision* of the audio clock (the resolution of its timestamps) is crucial for TDOA, and your "keep both times" approach preserves this high precision while correcting for long-term drift using NTP as a reference.
* **Audio Clock Stability:** The stability and linearity of the USB soundcard's internal clock will influence how well you can model and correct the drift.  A more stable clock will lead to more accurate drift correction.
* **Logging Frequency:** The frequency at which you log NTP timestamps relative to audio timestamps will impact the accuracy of your drift model. Higher logging frequency generally leads to better accuracy, especially for non-linear drift.
* **Synchronization Point Accuracy (if using separate processes):** If you are using a separate NTP logging process and synchronization points (like manual events), the accuracy of identifying these synchronization points will affect the overall time alignment.

**Practical Steps to Get Started:**

1. **Choose Audio Recording Software:** Select or develop audio recording software that allows you to access the USB soundcard, record raw audio, and ideally log timestamps from the audio device's internal clock.

2. **Implement NTP Time Logging:** Integrate NTP time logging into your audio recording software (or create a separate process).

3. **Test and Calibrate:**
   * **Short Test Recordings:** Do short test recordings (e.g., 1-2 hours) while logging both audio and NTP times.
   * **Analyze Drift:** Analyze the logged data to characterize the drift of your USB audio device's clock relative to NTP time. Determine if the drift is linear or requires a more complex model.
   * **Validate Mapping Accuracy:**  Test your drift correction and mapping process. You could introduce known time offsets in your audio and video streams and verify if your mapping and localization algorithms can accurately recover these offsets.

4. **Long-Duration Recordings:** Once you are confident in your setup and drift correction method, proceed with your 120-day recordings.

**In summary, your "keep both times" approach is the recommended strategy for your high-precision sound localization application. It addresses the audio clock drift issue effectively, avoids the complexities and potential imprecisions of real-time NTP clock correction, and provides the necessary data for accurate post-processing time alignment with your NTP-synchronized video streams.** You will be able to leverage the high accuracy of your GPS NTP server and the high-resolution timestamps of your USB audio device to achieve precise sound localization over your long recording period.

# IP Audio

Based on the provided documentation, Milestone’s video management system (**XProtect VMS**) explicitly relies on **Network Time Protocol (NTP)** for synchronization. The official Milestone documentation emphasizes using an NTP server (either a dedicated NTP server, domain controller, or the VMS server itself acting as an NTP server) for time synchronization.

**Implications for Your Project:**

- **Audio (AoIP / Dante):**
  - Your audio-over-IP setup (using Dante, AES67, or similar) can easily leverage **Precision Time Protocol (PTP)** for synchronization.
  - Dante/AES67 commonly use **PTPv2**, enabling microsecond-level accuracy ideal for audio synchronization.

- **Video (Milestone XProtect):**
  - Milestone systems explicitly recommend or require **NTP**.
  - Cameras and servers synchronize via standard NTP services (Microsoft or 3rd-party NTP servers).

**Can you use PTP directly with Milestone?**

- As of now, Milestone’s documentation does **not indicate support for PTP synchronization**. It explicitly outlines **NTP** as the synchronization standard.
- This means you cannot directly synchronize Milestone’s VMS or cameras using a PTP source without additional bridging solutions.

---

## Recommended Synchronization Strategy for your scenario:

Since your goal is to synchronize audio streams (using AoIP via Dante/PTP) with Milestone-managed IP cameras and video feeds (via NTP), you have two realistic options:

### Option 1 (Hybrid Sync - recommended):

- Set up a reliable **NTP server** as your primary timing reference (this could be a server already running Milestone).
- Sync all your Milestone-managed cameras and servers to this NTP server.
- Install a **PTP Grandmaster clock** (with GPS for absolute accuracy, if possible).
- Configure your **Dante/AES67 audio network** to use the PTP Grandmaster.
- Sync the PTP Grandmaster clock (audio) and NTP server (video) to the same absolute reference (GPS or common stable source). Many professional Grandmaster clocks can output both PTP and NTP simultaneously, ensuring tight synchronization between the two protocols.

**Pros:**
- Best of both worlds: Milestone video infrastructure remains NTP-compliant.
- Audio infrastructure retains PTP’s microsecond-level accuracy.

**Cons:**
- Additional complexity and cost (dedicated Grandmaster clock).

---

### Option 2 (NTP-only, simpler but lower accuracy):

- Use a single NTP server.
- Set Dante network to operate in **AES67 compatibility mode**, which supports PTPv2 derived from NTP. This approach may sacrifice some precision compared to pure PTP setups but will maintain synchronization sufficiently for many applications.

**Pros:**
- Very straightforward and minimal complexity.
- No specialized equipment required.

**Cons:**
- Lower synchronization precision (milliseconds rather than microseconds), may not be ideal for critical audio/video sync scenarios.

---

### Conclusion & Recommended Approach:

Given Milestone's explicit reliance on NTP, you cannot enforce PTP directly on their infrastructure. However, you are **not strictly limited** to NTP alone for audio. The recommended industry-standard solution is a **hybrid approach (Option 1)** using a Grandmaster clock providing both NTP and PTP outputs. This approach ensures:

- Perfect interoperability with Milestone via NTP.
- Precise audio synchronization via PTP for Dante/AES67 audio-over-IP.

This hybrid strategy represents best practice in professional broadcast/IP-audio environments.

Here's a concise and practical summary highlighting the key differences between the synchronization accuracy guarantees of **NTP** (Network Time Protocol) and **PTP** (Precision Time Protocol):

| Aspect                        | NTP (Network Time Protocol)                          | PTP (Precision Time Protocol - IEEE 1588)               |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Typical Accuracy**          | Milliseconds (1-10 ms typically)                     | Microseconds or sub-microseconds (<1 µs possible)      |
| **Accuracy Guarantee**        | No strict deterministic guarantees; network-dependent | Deterministic, with clearly defined accuracy levels     |
| **Network Requirements**      | Minimal: Can run over WAN/internet                   | High-quality local networks required for best accuracy  |
| **Infrastructure Complexity** | Simple; can run on standard networks                 | More complex; requires PTP-aware switches for highest precision |
| **Clock Hierarchy**           | Client-server (usually a public NTP server or local server)  | Master-follower (Grandmaster clock, boundary clocks, transparent clocks) |
| **Traffic Type**              | Typically unicast                                    | Multicast or Unicast (PTPv2 supports both; multicast is common) |
| **Use Cases**                 | General IT systems, general video surveillance (e.g., Milestone) | Professional broadcast, audio/video production, Dante/AES67 networks |
| **Failure Mode**              | Graceful drift; relatively large synchronization errors possible | Small and stable synchronization errors; highly stable clocking |

### Practical implications for your scenario:

- **NTP** is sufficient for general video recording (like Milestone XProtect), where millisecond-level accuracy is adequate to synchronize video frames and timestamps. This accuracy is typically sufficient for surveillance video, playback, and security purposes.

- **PTP** is essential for audio networks (Dante/AES67) in professional settings because it delivers sub-microsecond synchronization, necessary for precise phase-alignment and digital audio integrity—especially critical in scenarios involving live audio, multi-microphone arrays, and synchronized video-audio production workflows.

### In short:

- Use **NTP** when "close enough" synchronization is acceptable (milliseconds accuracy).
- Use **PTP** when high-precision synchronization (microsecond accuracy) is required, typically in professional audio or broadcast scenarios.

Given your scenario—integrating audio (AoIP/Dante) with video (Milestone)—the optimal setup would typically use a high-accuracy **PTP** for audio, with a secondary **NTP** service synchronized from the same PTP Grandmaster for Milestone’s video synchronization requirements.

Setting up a hybrid synchronization scenario (PTP for audio and NTP for video) with your RedNet MP8R is achievable but involves careful planning. Below is a clear outline of what you'll need to consider, specifically relating to the **RedNet MP8R** device capabilities and configuration:

---

### 1. **Is Hybrid Sync Tricky to Set Up?**

**Short answer:**  
It is more involved than using NTP or PTP alone, but very manageable with good planning.

**Detailed answer:**  
Hybrid synchronization involves ensuring that both your NTP-based video (Milestone) and your PTP-based audio (RedNet MP8R via Dante) derive their time from a common reference, typically a GPS-based Grandmaster clock. It's straightforward once the concept is understood, but you'll need specialized hardware (PTP Grandmaster with NTP output capability).

---

### 2. **RedNet MP8R and Sync Capabilities**

The RedNet MP8R supports the Dante audio-over-IP protocol, which uses Precision Time Protocol (**PTPv1** or **PTPv2/AES67**) as its synchronization standard:

- **RedNet MP8R Clocking:**
  - Automatically locks to a valid Dante network master (PTP).
  - Can act as the network master if required.
  - Supports pull-up/pull-down sample rates selectable via Dante Controller.

**Important Considerations from the RedNet MP8R Manual:**
- **Clock Source:** The MP8R automatically locks onto the Dante network's clock. If there isn't an existing network master, the MP8R can serve as the master.
- **Supported sample rates:** 44.1 / 48 / 88.2 / 96 / 176.4 / 192 kHz.
- **Redundancy:** Dual Ethernet connections and dual PSU inputs make the MP8R suitable for critical setups. Redundant network connections allow automatic failover.

---

### 3. **Hybrid Sync Setup Steps (Detailed for RedNet MP8R):**

**Step 1: Install a GPS-based Grandmaster Clock**
- Choose a Grandmaster clock device (e.g., Meinberg, Tekron, Evertz, or others).
- Device should provide both:
  - PTP output (IEEE 1588v2), ideally AES67 compliant.
  - NTP output (for Milestone VMS).

**Step 2: Configure Grandmaster**
- Set it up with GPS reference to provide highly accurate UTC-based time.
- Enable both **PTP output** and **NTP output**.

**Step 3: Configure Dante network (RedNet MP8R)**
- Connect the RedNet MP8R (via primary/secondary Dante ports) to a suitable network switch.
- Set Dante network to use the Grandmaster’s PTP clock as the master clock.
- RedNet MP8R will automatically lock to the PTP clock.

**Step 4: Configure Milestone VMS**
- Set Milestone's servers and IP cameras to synchronize with the **NTP output** from the same Grandmaster.
- Confirm NTP synchronization across Milestone servers and cameras.

**Step 5: Confirm Synchronization**
- Once configured, audio and video are synchronized indirectly through a common reference. The video uses NTP, and the audio uses PTP, both tracing back to the same Grandmaster.

---

### 4. **Critical Points to Consider**

- **Switch Compatibility:**  
  PTP accuracy depends on network hardware. Professional-grade switches with IEEE 1588 (PTP-aware switches) are recommended for microsecond-level accuracy.

- **Grandmaster Clock Accuracy:**  
  A GPS-based Grandmaster clock ensures absolute accuracy and a stable common time reference.

- **Network Topology & Traffic Management:**  
  Use VLANs to separate audio (PTP) from general network traffic to ensure timing accuracy and minimize jitter.

- **RedNet Control Software:**  
  Make use of the RedNet Control software provided by Focusrite to:
  - Check synchronization status.
  - Confirm clock status ("Network Locked" indicator on the MP8R front panel and software interface).
  - Manage channel configurations and gain compensation features.

---

### 5. **Potential Challenges**

- **Mixed Protocol Management:**  
  Managing two synchronization protocols (NTP and PTP) simultaneously introduces complexity; clearly document settings.
- **Budget & Equipment:**  
  The need for specialized Grandmaster clock equipment may impact your budget.
- **Technical Knowledge:**  
  Familiarity with Dante Controller, network management, and synchronization technology is required.

---

### 6. **Benefits of the Hybrid Approach**

- **Accuracy:**  
  Audio synchronization remains precise (microsecond accuracy), ensuring the integrity of bioacoustic recordings.
- **Milestone Integration:**  
  Full compatibility with Milestone VMS through NTP, fulfilling their explicit synchronization requirement.
- **Scalability:**  
  Future expansions (more audio or video devices) remain straightforward and centrally manageable.

---

### 7. **Conclusion & Recommendation**

- While the hybrid synchronization solution is slightly more complex initially, it ensures:
  - Optimal synchronization accuracy for audio (via PTP/Dante).
  - Compliance with Milestone's NTP requirement for video.
  - Highly reliable operation, crucial for long-term bioacoustic monitoring projects.

Given the robust clocking and redundancy features of the **RedNet MP8R**, your choice to use this device positions your setup very effectively for professional-level synchronization and reliability.
