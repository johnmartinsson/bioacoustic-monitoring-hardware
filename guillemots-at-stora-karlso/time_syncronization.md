Based on the provided documentation, Milestone’s video management system (**XProtect VMS**) explicitly relies on **Network Time Protocol (NTP)** for synchronization. The official Milestone documentation emphasizes using an NTP server (either a dedicated NTP server, domain controller, or the VMS server itself acting as an NTP server) for time synchronization.

**Implications for Your Project:**

- **Audio (AoIP / Dante):**
  - Your audio-over-IP setup (using Dante, AES67, or similar) can easily leverage **Precision Time Protocol (PTP)** for synchronization.
  - Dante/AES67 commonly use **PTPv2**, enabling microsecond-level accuracy ideal for audio synchronization.

- **Video (Milestone XProtect):**
  - Milestone systems explicitly recommend or require **NTP**.
  - Cameras and servers synchronize via standard NTP services (Microsoft or 3rd-party NTP servers).

**Can you use PTP directly with Milestone?**

- As of now, Milestone’s documentation does **not indicate support for PTP synchronization**. It explicitly outlines **NTP** as the synchronization standard.
- This means you cannot directly synchronize Milestone’s VMS or cameras using a PTP source without additional bridging solutions.

## Recommended Synchronization Strategy for your scenario:

Since your goal is to synchronize audio streams (using AoIP via Dante/PTP) with Milestone-managed IP cameras and video feeds (via NTP), you have two realistic options:

### Option 1 (Hybrid Sync - recommended):

- Set up a reliable **NTP server** as your primary timing reference (this could be a server already running Milestone).
- Sync all your Milestone-managed cameras and servers to this NTP server.
- Install a **PTP Grandmaster clock** (with GPS for absolute accuracy, if possible).
- Configure your **Dante/AES67 audio network** to use the PTP Grandmaster.
- Sync the PTP Grandmaster clock (audio) and NTP server (video) to the same absolute reference (GPS or common stable source). Many professional Grandmaster clocks can output both PTP and NTP simultaneously, ensuring tight synchronization between the two protocols.

**Pros:**
- Best of both worlds: Milestone video infrastructure remains NTP-compliant.
- Audio infrastructure retains PTP’s microsecond-level accuracy.

**Cons:**
- Additional complexity and cost (dedicated Grandmaster clock).

### Option 2 (NTP-only, simpler but lower accuracy):

- Use a single NTP server.
- Set Dante network to operate in **AES67 compatibility mode**, which supports PTPv2 derived from NTP. This approach may sacrifice some precision compared to pure PTP setups but will maintain synchronization sufficiently for many applications.

**Pros:**
- Very straightforward and minimal complexity.
- No specialized equipment required.

**Cons:**
- Lower synchronization precision (milliseconds rather than microseconds), may not be ideal for critical audio/video sync scenarios.

### Conclusion & Recommended Approach:

Given Milestone's explicit reliance on NTP, you cannot enforce PTP directly on their infrastructure. However, you are **not strictly limited** to NTP alone for audio. The recommended industry-standard solution is a **hybrid approach (Option 1)** using a Grandmaster clock providing both NTP and PTP outputs. This approach ensures:

- Perfect interoperability with Milestone via NTP.
- Precise audio synchronization via PTP for Dante/AES67 audio-over-IP.

This hybrid strategy represents best practice in professional broadcast/IP-audio environments.
