# TODO
# - Speak at different intensities inside of the Auklab to understand if and when that speech signal is picked up by the microphones
# - Payback different sound events at the ledges
# - Write a script that does some or most of this. Maybe add the "speech inside" and "events ledges" scenarios, so we can playback them when there.
