## Component Roles Summary

### Clock Pi
- Acts as a **Stratum-1 NTP server**, synchronizing time via GPS.
- Provides accurate time to the Recording Pi over the local network.
- ([Could also simply buy a NTP001 from Teltonika.](https://www.dustinhome.se/product/5020038273/ntp001-ntp-server))

### Recording Pi
- Records audio files to local storage.
- Syncs system time from Clock Pi to ensure timestamp accuracy.
- Runs a simple script to back up files to a local USB drive (rsync --verified).
- Shares its audio directory with the Analytics Pi via SSHFS.

### Analytics Pi
- Mounts directories from both the Recording Pi (SSHFS) and NAS (NFS).
- Runs the backup and verification script:
  - Detects new and complete files.
  - Transfers files to NAS using `rsync --verified`.
  - Maintains logs of transferred and verified files.
- Pools all logs and push weekly/daily status update

### NAS
- Serves as long-term storage for verified audio recordings.
- Receives files via NFS mount from the Analytics Pi.

### USB Drive (on Recording Pi)
- Acts as a local backup destination.
- Files are copied via a basic script with no hash verification.

## Tested 2025-03-28

The setup has been tested by mounting the recording pi audio directory and using a laptop to act as the NAS by simply creating a directory. Recording is done on the recording pi, and then everything is transferred and verified by the analytics pi. Example output below:
